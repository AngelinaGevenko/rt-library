# Routing library for Green Navigation

This application is just a demo to show the GreenNav front-end. The "real" routing application is currently under development and will be ready for GSoC 17 :smiley:

## Installation

```zsh
npm install
npm run server
```

__caution__: make sure that you have nodejs available as `node` in your path.
